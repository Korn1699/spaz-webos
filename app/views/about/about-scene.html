		You are currently running a preview release of Spaz for webOS, an <strong>open source</strong> Twitter client. We think this version is pretty darn good, but we have more planned for 1.0, including:

		<ul>
			<li>Ping.FM integration</li>
			<li>Uploading photos and images</li>
			<li>Integration with Synergy</li>
			<li>Search history &amp; saved searches</li>
		</ul>

		Our plan is to charge $3 for the 1.0 version. This money will be used to cover hosting costs and compensate our contributors when possible.<br><br>
